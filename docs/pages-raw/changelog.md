## Version 3.1.0

* 24 specialized tools covering portfolio details, transactions, order safety builders, dry-run previews, and execution
* Non-interactive headless re-authentication flow to prevent standard stdin deadlocks on token expiry

## Version 3.0.5
* Added support for new app secret / app key lengths

## Version 3.0.4

## Version 3.0.1
* Issue with async streamer token updating fixed.

## Version 3.0.0
* Added Asyncronous Client (`schwabdev.ClientAsync`) for async/await usage
* Added Asyncronous Streamer (`schwabdev.StreamAsync`) for async/await usage
    * Stream now initialized as `schwabdev.Stream(client)` or `schwabdev.StreamAsync(client)`
* Tokens backend rework to use an sqlite database instead of a json file for concurrency handling.
* Added support for multiple clients running at the same time (sharing the same tokens database).
* Added optional encryption for tokens database using `cryptography.fernet`
* Standard client no longer uses a background thread to check tokens, and instead checks/refreshes tokens on each request.
* Now including streamer fields with package.
* Removed parameters `call_on_notify` and `capture_callback`; replaced with `call_on_auth` (called with auth url, expected to return the callback url or code).
* Renamed several api calls to be more intuitive;
    * `client.account_linked()` -> `client.linked_accounts()`
    * `client.order_place()` -> `client.place_order()`
    * `client.order_cancel()` -> `client.cancel_order()`
    * `client.order_replace()` -> `client.replace_order()`
    * New api call: `client.preview_order()` 


## Version 2.5.1

## Version 2.5.0
* Added parameter `call_on_notify` which calls a function before the refresh token is about to expire
